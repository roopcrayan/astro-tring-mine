                    In today’s fast-moving world, owning a vehicle is more than just
                    convenience. For many people, a car or bike represents freedom,
                    success, and new journeys in life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Indian culture, buying a vehicle is not only about the purchase —
                    timing also matters. Choosing the right Muhurat is believed to bring
                    good luck, safety, and positive energy.

                    planetary positions and are believed to support success and
                    well-being.
                </p>

                    Why is Muhurat Important for Buying a Car or Bike?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Muhurat has a special place in Indian traditions. It is believed that
                    starting something new during an auspicious time increases the chance
                    of positive outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Buying a vehicle marks the beginning of many journeys. Choosing the
                    right Muhurat is thought to bring protection, improve the life of the
                    vehicle, and attract prosperity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Astrologers suggest selecting a time when planets support new
                    beginnings. This is believed to reduce chances of accidents, avoid
                    frequent mechanical problems, and bring peace of mind to the owner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A well-chosen Muhurat can help you feel confident, secure, and happy
                    with your new car or bike.
