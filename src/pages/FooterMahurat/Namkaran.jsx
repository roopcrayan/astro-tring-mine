                <p>
                    Namkaran, also known as the Naming Ceremony, is an important Hindu ritual
                    where a newborn baby is given their name. This name becomes a part of
                    the child’s identity for life. The ceremony is performed on an
                    auspicious day (Muhurat) to bring positive energy and a bright future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Family members and friends come together to bless the baby with good
                    health, happiness, and prosperity. Choosing the right Namkaran Muhurat
                    in 2026 is believed to create a strong and positive foundation for the
                    child’s life.

                    Astrological Importance of Namkaran
                </h2>

                <p>
                    In astrology, the timing of the Namkaran ceremony is very important.
                    The best Muhurat is selected by studying planetary positions and lunar
                    movements.
                </p>

                <p>The following factors are considered:</p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tithi:</strong> Auspicious lunar days, especially during
                        Shukla Paksha (waxing moon), are preferred.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Nakshatra:</strong> Favorable Nakshatras like Pushya,
                        Ashwini, and Swati are considered good for naming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rahu–Ketu:</strong> Rahu Kalam and Ketu Kalam are avoided to
                        prevent negative effects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Panchang:</strong> Tithi, Nakshatra, Vara (day), Karana, and
