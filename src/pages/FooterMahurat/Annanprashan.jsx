                    Annaprashan is a sacred Hindu ceremony that marks a baby’s first intake
                    of solid food. In Sanskrit, <strong>Anna</strong> means food and{" "}
                    <strong>Prashan</strong> means feeding. Together, Annaprashan represents
                    the child’s first step toward receiving nourishment from nature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This ceremony is an important milestone in a child’s life. It also
                    symbolises growth, health, and spiritual development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In different regions of India, Annaprashan is celebrated in different
                    ways. In Bengal, it is called <strong>Bhatkhulai</strong>, while other
                    states follow their own traditions — all with the same sacred purpose.

                    According to Jyotish Shastra, performing Annaprashan during an auspicious
