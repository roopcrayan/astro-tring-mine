        <p>
          Marriage is a sacred bond that joins two people and their families.
          It is a beautiful journey filled with love, commitment, and shared
          traditions.

        <p>
          In astrology, choosing the right Marriage Muhurat is very important.
          A Muhurat is an auspicious date and time that helps start married life
          with positive energy. In 2026, many couples will follow this tradition
          to bring harmony, prosperity, and happiness into their relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marriage Muhurat is decided by studying planetary positions, moon
          phases, and other astrological factors. Astrologers suggest special
          dates in 2026 that are believed to support a peaceful and successful
          married life.
