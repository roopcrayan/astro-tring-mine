                    Mundan, also called Chudakarana or Chutak, is an important Hindu
                    ceremony. It is the child’s first haircut and marks the beginning of a
                    new phase in life.

                    Even though it looks like a simple haircut, Mundan has deep spiritual
                    meaning. It is believed that this ritual removes negative energy and
                    brings blessings for good health, wisdom, and success.

                    In 2026, choosing the right Mundan Muhurat is very important. Performing
                    the ceremony at an auspicious time helps align the child’s energy with
                    the universe and creates a positive start for their future.

                    Why Timing Matters for Mundan in 2026
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Selecting a Shubh Muhurat ensures that the ceremony happens when
                    planetary energies are favorable. This helps protect the child from
                    negative influences and supports emotional and physical well-being.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Astrologers check the child’s birth chart, planet positions, moon
                    phases, and Nakshatras before finalizing the Mundan date. Doing the
                    ritual at the right time is believed to bring divine blessings and a
                    bright future.
